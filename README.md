### explanation: I find this article interesting because it contains a lot of recent relevant data regarding the usage of generative AI, a topic that impacts us all currently. One of the more interesting points of data presented is that there's been a rise in the number of prompts that ask for code and/or programs while there's been a decrease in the number of prompts that ask for debugging, implying that either: 1. generative AI (or Claude at least in this case) has improved to the point where most people can ask it to complete entire projects on its own, or 2. the userbase has gotten more used to relying on it for entire workflows and generally do less on their own (or both of these). I think that even if you don't believe generative AI is a serious risk in the near future for things like job security, it's still interesting to keep an eye on because it definitely has impacted and will continue to impact the way we develop software in the future.

I think that the graphs on usage were interesting!

AI is quickly shifting from being just a helper to being a co-developer in some sense.
